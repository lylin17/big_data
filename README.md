# Spatial-Temporal Analysis of Chicago Taxi Rides

This is a 2-student group project for CS5103 Statistics taken under the Master of Science in Business Analytics programme in NUS. The course delved deeply into traditional statistical (machine) learning models (e.g. logistic regression and decision trees) and model ensembles (e.g. random forest and boosted trees). Although not as glamorous as the buzz around deep learning models nowadays, this module provided much needed foundation building to machine learning before going into more advanced topics. The project centers on using classification models to predict the results of the 2017 NCAA March Madness tournament based on the teams’ performance in the regular season  As this is a course on traditional models, deep learning and other more advanced algorithm were not considered. Raw data used was from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2017/data).
